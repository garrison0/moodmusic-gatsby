one day you’ll wake up in silicon valley and realize all you need in life is toothpaste, a toothbrush, and a laptop. and a girlfriend with a shower and a club key that gives you access to a spa. so you ditch the idea of workawaying and decide to sleep in your car. OK. this is just step one. some would call this homeless but it’s really just the entrepreneurial spirit. an entrepreneur needs to be focused.

wake up each morning and pray in the direction of apple park. then sit at the local starbucks in cupertino and work on programming your new startup idea. tape a picture of your future tesla to the back of your macbook and stare at it whenever you feel discouraged.

the car you just bought is still there whenever you need to sob in it. you’re getting plenty of value out of it by doing this. if you put the backseat of your car on airbnb in the bay area you could sell it for forty dollars a night with a twenty dollar cleaning fee. 

look for networking events in your area on facebook. inform everyone at the talk that they're statistically only going to hire one or two people in this crowd of 100 but you have an unbelievable opportunity for the rest.
