Did you know you can easily generate a sample of pseudo-random numbers from an exponential distribution using only a uniform distribution (like Math.random())?

Just use the quantile for the distribution and set lambda equal to 1. This gives you:

```js
// lambda = 1;
// truncated exponential distribution b/w 0 and 1
// returns value from 0 to 1, more often closer to 0.
function expDistribution () {
  return -Math.log(Math.random()) % 1;
}
```

Take the result % 1 to get values between 0 to 1. Multiply by some scalar if you need a larger range. If you're wondering, yes it'll still be an exponential distribution when you take the modulo. There's a proof out there you can find! This idea is used in Monte Carlo simulations. But you can use it in games, creative experiments, or whatever you like.
