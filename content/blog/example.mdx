you can easily generate a sample of pseudo-random numbers from an exponential distribution using only a uniform distribution (like Math.random())

just use the quantile for the distribution and set lambda equal to 1:

```js
// lambda = 1;
// truncated exponential distribution b/w 0 and 1
// returns value from 0 to 1, more often closer to 0.
function expDistribution () {
  return -Math.log(Math.random()) % 1;
}
```

taking the result modulo 1 gives you values between 0 to 1. multiply by some scalar if you need a larger range. this idea is used in Monte Carlo simulations. but you can use it in games, creative experiments, or whatever you like.
