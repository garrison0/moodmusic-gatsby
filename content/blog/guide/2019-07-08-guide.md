so hopefully by now you blew your engine on the highway and instead of giving up and going home your first thought was “oh… well I guess I gotta buy a new car" so you rode 5 hours in the wrong direction and began your search

before this you should’ve established that you towed your car to a service shop that didn’t charge daily storage fees or $100 to tell you that something is horribly, irrepairably wrong. you should regret skipping that oil change. 

maybe you've met the friendly highway patrol man that gave you the friendliest threat in the world. essentially: 

“hi you have two hours to remove the vehicle from the highway or it’ll be impounded with all your stuff here’s some water btw don’t die lol i’ll be back later”

since there’s no rush according to the service shop (right?), you can get AAA premium and tow it for free up to 200 miles after a 3 day initial membership. if that’s not enough time, just get it on the way back. if that’s not enough miles, hope you have a friend who can hitch it with a truck or you’re willing to pay more to tow it farther

meanwhile you're in god's favorite country so go get drunk

anyways, back to car purchasing

you need to establish the following information to see how possible this is:

1. Can you register the vehicle in the state you’re purchasing it from without being a resident? (in my case, no)
2. Does your state of residency allow registration by mail? (in my case, no)
3. Can you insure the vehicle with your state of residency’s insurance even though it’s registered in another state? (surprisingly, in my case, yes)

you can find all this out through calling insurance agents and the DMVs of both states. even a dealership just to get started (even though you totally aren’t buying a car from them)

let’s assume the second worst possible case which may or may not have been mine - you can’t register the car in the state you’re buying it from and you can’t register it in your home state until you get back. and you’re traveling for more than 30 days so a temp plate won’t cut it. 

remember the friend that picked you up? time to establish a relationship of trust

since he’s a resident, transfer the title at the DMV to a co-ownership under the “OR” option (meaning either can act as the sole owner and sell it without the other’s signature), then have it co-registered with his name listed first. this’ll get you license plates. just note the co-registration under the insurance and insure it yourself. unless the answer to #3 is also no.. in which case you have to pay off your friend to insure it

as for finding a car wherever you are, good luck, just make sure you take it to a well-rated mechanic to have it checked out before you buy it.

once again it’s all about who you know. so much for your emergency funds.

make sure to take solace in the fact that your final destination is only the second most expensive metro in the US. sob quietly in your new car when necessary.
