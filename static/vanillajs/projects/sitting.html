        Wondering what's going on here? In 1969, Alvin Lucier recorded himself talking in a room.
        Then he recorded the recording of himself played on a speaker across the room.
        Then he recorded that recording played across the room, across the room. About 30 times.  <br/><br/>
        Eventually the signal came to be dominated by the resonant frequencies of the room
        and lost most other audible qualities. And now music tech people talk about it.  <br/><br/>
        This simulates that process with convolution reverb. It just feeds the wet signal back
        into the reverb each iteration, for the given number of iterations, and plays the result for you. 
        It's rough - WebAudio lacks a useful built-in limiter, so it'll tend to explode. Have fun. <br/><br/>
        Select a file and the number of times to put it through the reverb. A default sample is provided from
        "Songs My Mother Taught Me" by Charles Ives.<br/><br/>
        The max number of times is 30, but it tends to become purely tonal by iteration 10.
