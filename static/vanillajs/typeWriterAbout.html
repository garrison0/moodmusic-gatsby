            At age 6, I was born in the rolling hillsides of Lancaster County, Pennsylvania. My parents found me wrapped in a husk of corn. As they unpeeled my fibrous shackles, they wept, and I cried out, “woof woof, daddy, woof woof.”

            I proceeded to grow up small and feeble. I made my international debut by moving to Pittsburgh in 2014 for college, increasing my “have-travelled-to radius” to 250 miles.

            The University of Pittsburgh, what a school! I liked it so much, I left. I transferred to Carnegie Mellon University in 2016 where I realized my heart is in the work, but not this work in particular. So, I re-arranged my Pitt-Milieu-Inspired Philosophy PhD plans to become… an audio engineer… in order to support my illustrious music career potential. A month later, I was taking sound recording. 2 months later, I was part of the recording crew in the school of music. 5 months later, I had a formal internship running sound and doing production for a local band. 
          </p>
          <p class="characters">
            As graduation neared, and the audio experience accumulated, I realized that despite taking some pretty terse mathematics, a course in algorithms, machine learning, etc., and having written a (most-probably sophomoric) thesis in philosophical logic, I was headed straight for a lovely, satisfying career of clicking microphones onto stands and taping cables to the floor. To rectify this, a month after graduating, in January of 2019, I flew straight to India. Then I spent another month in Tanzania. This increased my “having-travelled-to radius” to a more satisfying number. 
          </p>
          <p class="characters">
            I came back. I had to figure something out. I lived with a professor-friend and worked odd jobs in Pittsburgh for a few months. I landed a more stable audio gig. Then, in June of 2019, I took the safe option and drove across the country to the west coast. In my quasi-homeless state, surviving primarily from my car (#2 of the roadtrip), and ritually praying in the direction of Apple Park three times a day, I began learning front-end development. 
          </p>
          <p class="characters">
            Then I drove back to Pittsburgh, with plans to go further east. I went to the wrong coast, it seems.

            Unfortunately, employers are not often keen on hiring engineers without direct experience. Neither time spent on audio nor previous summers spent paying my rent as a temporary “industrial assembler” helped my job search. But they don’t know what they don’t know - you learn something. Waking up at 5:30am, driving 25 minutes past Kreider Farms, past some nameless train tracks, and past more than a few cornfields, to get to your small manufacturing company’s building and sand a few thousand pieces of wood for 8 hours. 5 days a week. For two months. You learn something, so they tell me. You just don’t realize it. In fact, I still haven’t.

            I am now preparing for an internship as a full-stack engineer. I’ve been exploring the creative possibilities of the web stack through my project work. I’m interested in the mythical role of a developer with a creative voice. Something that utilizes my jack-of-all-trades skillset and wide interest range.
